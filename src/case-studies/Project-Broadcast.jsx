                            <p>Imagine being dropped into a world where you have to create something totally new—a brand, from scratch. That's exactly what I faced with Project Broadcast. It was exciting but also kind of overwhelming.</p>

                                    When I arrived projectbroadcast.com was a single page site, odd font usage and the features list at the bottom spanned over 6000 pixels long.

                            <h2>Engaging with Our Customers</h2>
                            <p>Working at Project Broadcast, a text marketing platform, offered me a distinctive and beneficial role. With our product centered around text messaging services, I enjoyed a rare chance to interact directly with our customers.</p>

                            <h2>Discovering Our Users</h2>
                            <p>The Project Broadcast user demographic skews towards women aged 30 to 50, often balancing small business ownership with daily responsibilities. This engaged community actively participates in webinars and industry events, sharing knowledge and resources to enhance their skills and business strategies.</p>
                            <div className="details--inline">

                            <h2>Crafting the Brand's Tone and Illustration Style</h2>
                            <p>Upon reviewing our users' messages and interactions, a notable trend surfaced: the widespread use of emojis to infuse personality and liveliness into their communication. This discovery prompted a profound realization – our brand must reflect the dynamic and spirited essence of our audience. </p>
                            <div className="details--inline">
                                <div className="details--left"><img src="/michael-stevens-project-broadcast-illustration-style.png" alt="" /></div>
                                <div className="details--right">This illustration style captured the fun, bright, and playful essence of the customers I encountered.</div>
                            </div>
                            <div style={{height:24}}></div>
                            <p>Instead of dull colors, I used bright ones and added fun designs, like basic shapes that looked like emojis. Every detail was carefully chosen to make people feel energized and happy when they used our platform. After a few months of building bits and pieces I started to assemble a brand book.</p>
                            <div className="details--inline">

                                <div className="details--right">As I worked I began to assemble a brand book to capature everything from the look, tone and feel of the site, but also to capture the why around Project Broadcast.</div>

                            <h2>Designing of the Branding</h2>
                            <p>Designing the logo was driven by my own dissatisfaction rather than a formal request from the business. Despite their contentment with the wifi symbol as their logo, I felt it didn't sufficiently represent the brand. Inspiration struck when I encountered an illustration experimenting with a 3D effect, igniting the idea to make our logo stand out.</p>

                            <p>Ensuring that our brand resonated with our users was a top priority throughout our journey. To achieve this, I formed a special group called the "Product Council." This group consisted of users who were among the first to embrace our platform—our early adopters.</p>

                            <h2>Crafting the Marketing Site</h2>
                            <p>After analyzing our competitors' sites, I noticed certain patterns that seemed to repeat consistently throughout our industry. I set out to create a website that not only captured the essence of our brand but also spoke the language of our users.</p>
