                            <p>My experience at Skullcandy was truly memorable. It was a sunny day in Park City, Utah, and as I stepped out for lunch, a friend from Skullcandy pulled up with some colleagues in a black SUV and invited me to join him for lunch. Riding in a black SUV with tinted windows honestly felt like I had been kidnapped by someone from the mob. I soon found myself offered a job and being employed at Skullcandy, where they had just completed a platform redesign and were already planning another for six months down the road.</p>

                            <h2>Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
                            <p>Upon arrival, I identified significant usability issues in the newly designed platform. Rather than immediately proceeding with the impending site launch, I persuaded the team to delay the launch to address these issues. By tackling navigation and homepage concerns beforehand, we set the stage for more substantial improvements.</p>
                            <div className="details--inline">
                                <div className="details--left"><img src="/michael-stevens-skullcandy-header.png" alt="" /></div>
                                <div className="details--right">The header lacked essential elements that every user expects, including login, cart, and support links. Additionally, it featured duplicate navigations: one resembling tabs, but unexpectedly reloading the page, causing disorientation.</div>
                            </div>                 
                            <div style={{height:48}}></div>
                            <h2>Optimization Efforts</h2>
                            <p>Post-launch, my Product Manager and I focused on optimizing the platform. We identified and rectified critical issues such as the placement of the buy box and inefficient product color selection processes. Additionally, we revamped the search and browse experience for enhanced user engagement.</p>
                            <div className="details--inline">
                                <div className="details--left"><img src="/michael-stevens-post-launch-optimization.png" alt="" /></div>
                                <div className="details--right">The initial release launched with the buy box on the left side. Previous design test I had run always indicated that buy boxes performed better on the right. We ran an A/B test and sure enough the buy box performed better on the right.</div>
                            </div>
                            <div className="details--inline">
                                <div className="details--left"><img src="/michael-stevens-skullcandy-search.png" alt="" /></div>
                                <div className="details--right">They listed each color as a separate page for SEO purposes, but this strategy backfired. It led to a poor user experience, requiring page reloads for each color view, and harmed their SEO with duplicate pages containing similar content.</div>

                            <h2>Preperations for Rebranding</h2>
                            <p>The company announced a widespread rebranding initiative, which included updating the website. With the absence of a common "design system" practice, I recognized the need to preserve our previous work and optimizations. Transitioning from Photoshop to Adobe Fireworks, a precursor to modern design tools like Sketch or Figma, allowed for the creation of reusable components and centralized updates. This preparation ensured that all of our existing work and all component states would not get lost in the rebranding.</p>

                            <h2>Navigating the Rebrand</h2>
                            <p>Collaborating closely with the graphic design team, I adapted the platform to align with the new brand aesthetic. Despite challenges, such as the strict adherence to a black-and-white color scheme, I successfully integrated the new design elements while preserving usability and functionality. With a little influence from me we even implemented the use of a single blue color for links and call-to-actions.</p>

                            <p>This marked a pivotal moment in my time at Skullcandy where I had the chance to transition from inheriting existing designs to crafting something entirely original and uniquely reflective of my creative vision. It presented an exciting opportunity to infuse my personal style, preferences, and innovative ideas into the design process, resulting in a fresh and distinctive outcome.</p>
                            <p>The process started of by understanding what was going on in the competitive landscape.</p>

                            <p>The most significant alterations were made to the structure of the homepage, which needed to embody the essence of the new branding. We carefully curated the information displayed and paid particular attention to the navigation, ensuring it accurately reflected the brand's new focus.</p>
                            <div className="details--inline">

                            <p>In conclusion, my tenure at Skullcandy was characterized by a commitment to user-centric design and continuous optimization. In all the companies website underwent three redesigns in the short amount of time I was there. By addressing usability issues, navigating a rebrand, and implementing a robust design system, I contributed to enhancing the platform's user experience and aligning it with the company's evolving brand identity.</p>
