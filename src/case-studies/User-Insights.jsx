                <div style={{height:24}}></div>   
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Interviewer:</strong> The primary role responsible for conducting the test, asking questions, and guiding the participant through the interview process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scribe:</strong> Tasked with taking detailed notes if recording is not possible, ensuring that important insights and observations are documented.</li>
                    <li><strong>Observers:</strong> Individuals from the business with a stake in the test who wish to sit in on the interview to gather additional insights and perspectives.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Closed Questions:</strong> Avoid questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," as they limit the depth of the response and may hinder valuable insights.
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>Bad Example:</i> "Did you go out of town for the Holidays?" "Yes…"</li>
                            <li><i>Good Example:</i> "What did you do on your Holiday?" "We went to California and spent some time on the beach."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Leading Questions:</strong> Refrain from asking questions that prompt or encourage the desired answer, as they can bias the participant's response.
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>Bad Example:</i> Interviewee: “I noticed this picture here.” Interviewer: “You mentioned that the picture was helpful... Which they ever actually did.”</li>
                            <li><i>Good Example:</i> Interviewee: “I noticed this picture here.” Interviewer: “You noticed the picture?”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Questions with Many Conjunctions:</strong> Avoid asking overly complex questions with multiple conjunctions, as they can confuse participants and dilute the clarity of the inquiry.
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>Bad Example:</i> “When you travel do you like to take public transportation or rent a car or maybe even catch a Lyft?"</li>
                            <li><i>Good Example:</i> “What kind of transportation do you take when you travel?”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Alignment with Expectations:</strong> Evaluate whether the interview outcomes align with your initial expectations or hypotheses. Recognize any areas where your assumptions were validated and where they may need adjustment based on the user feedback.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After processing your impressions, proceed to create interview summaries:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Summarize Key Points:</strong> Condense the main findings and observations from the interview into a concise summary. Highlight the most significant insights, trends, or patterns that emerged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extract Quotes and Reactions:</strong> Pull out compelling quotes, noteworthy reactions, or impactful moments from the interview. These can serve as powerful anecdotes to illustrate key points or user experiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Present to Stakeholders:</strong> Share the interview summaries, quotes, and reactions with relevant stakeholders. Emphasize positive reactions and insights that demonstrate the value of the research findings.</li>
                </ul>
