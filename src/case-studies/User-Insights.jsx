                <h2>What is a user interview?</h2>
                <p>A user interview blends observation and one-on-one questioning to glean insights into people's behaviors, habits, and differences.</p>
                <div style={{height:24}}></div>   
                <h2>Different Methods of User Interviews</h2>
                <h4>Moderated Usability Testing</h4>
                <p>Guided sessions where a facilitator collects feedback while users interact with the product.</p>
                <h4>Unmoderated Usability Testing</h4>
                <p>Users independently test the product, and interactions are recorded for analysis.</p>
                <h4>Testing Logic and Navigation</h4>
                <p>Methods like card sorting and tree testing ensure a product's logic and navigation are intuitive.</p>
                <h4>Design Testing</h4>
                <p>Evaluates design elements through methods like A/B testing and eye-tracking.</p>

                <h4>Succeed, Hesitate or Fail</h4>
                <p>Notice if users breeze through, pause, or face challenges.</p>
                <h4>Understanding</h4>
                <p>Try to understand what’s behind their behaviors</p>

                <h2>The Art of Conducting an Interview</h2>
                <h4>Assigning Interviewer Roles:</h4>
                <div style={{height:24}}></div>   
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Interviewer:</strong> The primary role responsible for conducting the test, asking questions, and guiding the participant through the interview process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scribe:</strong> Tasked with taking detailed notes if recording is not possible, ensuring that important insights and observations are documented.</li>
                    <li><strong>Observers:</strong> Individuals from the business with a stake in the test who wish to sit in on the interview to gather additional insights and perspectives.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Responses to Avoid During Interviews:</h4>
                <div style={{height:24}}></div>   
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Closed Questions:</strong> Avoid questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," as they limit the depth of the response and may hinder valuable insights.
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>Bad Example:</i> "Did you go out of town for the Holidays?" "Yes…"</li>
                            <li><i>Good Example:</i> "What did you do on your Holiday?" "We went to California and spent some time on the beach."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Leading Questions:</strong> Refrain from asking questions that prompt or encourage the desired answer, as they can bias the participant's response.
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>Bad Example:</i> Interviewee: “I noticed this picture here.” Interviewer: “You mentioned that the picture was helpful... Which they ever actually did.”</li>
                            <li><i>Good Example:</i> Interviewee: “I noticed this picture here.” Interviewer: “You noticed the picture?”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Questions with Many Conjunctions:</strong> Avoid asking overly complex questions with multiple conjunctions, as they can confuse participants and dilute the clarity of the inquiry.
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>Bad Example:</i> “When you travel do you like to take public transportation or rent a car or maybe even catch a Lyft?"</li>
                            <li><i>Good Example:</i> “What kind of transportation do you take when you travel?”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Types of Questions to Ask:</h4>
                <div style={{height:24}}></div>   
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tasks:</strong> Prompt participants to demonstrate how they would complete specific actions or tasks within the product.</li>
                    <li><strong>Participation:</strong> Encourage participants to show how they would navigate or interact with the product, putting themselves in the user's shoes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demonstration:</strong> Request a demonstration of a particular feature or functionality to gain insights into user preferences and behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elaboration:</strong> Invite participants to provide additional details or insights on a topic to deepen understanding and uncover hidden motivations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sequence:</strong>Ask participants to walk through their typical process or workflow, revealing patterns and pain points in their user journey.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specific Examples:</strong> Inquire about specific instances or experiences related to the product to gain concrete insights into user behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peer Comparison:</strong> Explore how participants perceive others' experiences or behaviors in comparison to their own, uncovering social influences and norms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expectation:</strong> Probe participants about their expectations or anticipated outcomes when interacting with the product, revealing discrepancies between expectation and reality.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Reviewing the Interview</h2>
                <p>Do this as soon as possible after the interview. Critical observations will be lost in your memory if you delay too long. Complete your personal notes and store all notes on the interview in a central location. If you recorded the session, consider transcribing it.</p>
                <p>Discuss your first impressions based off the interview:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Surprising Findings:</strong> Note anything unexpected or surprising that emerged during the interview. These could be insights that challenge your assumptions or shed new light on the problem at hand.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Insights:</strong> Identify any fresh perspectives or ideas that came to light during the interview. These could be innovative solutions, user behaviors, or needs that you hadn't previously considered.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment with Expectations:</strong> Evaluate whether the interview outcomes align with your initial expectations or hypotheses. Recognize any areas where your assumptions were validated and where they may need adjustment based on the user feedback.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After processing your impressions, proceed to create interview summaries:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Summarize Key Points:</strong> Condense the main findings and observations from the interview into a concise summary. Highlight the most significant insights, trends, or patterns that emerged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extract Quotes and Reactions:</strong> Pull out compelling quotes, noteworthy reactions, or impactful moments from the interview. These can serve as powerful anecdotes to illustrate key points or user experiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Present to Stakeholders:</strong> Share the interview summaries, quotes, and reactions with relevant stakeholders. Emphasize positive reactions and insights that demonstrate the value of the research findings.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember that interviews don’t just happen during the interview, they are everything that comes before, during and after.</p>
